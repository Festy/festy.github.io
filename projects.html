                    Currently working as a software engineer for GoToMeeting web app (<a target="_blank" href="https://app.gotomeeting.com">https://app.gotomeeting.com</a>).
                    Mainly used KnockoutJS and Durandal framework to develop multiple features such as <a href="#" onclick="return false;" id="callme-popover">Call Me</a>
                    Added multi-browser support (Firefox, IE 10-11, Edge) and developed GoToMeeting ChromeBox Kiosk app.
                    Brought ideas to the table to reduce meeting and audio connection time. Successfully reduced computer audio join time under 30 sec for 99% users.
                    Configured CatchPoint, Google Analytics and internal telemetry system to monitor features usage and performance.
